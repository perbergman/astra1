## Objectives
* How to connect to Astra via the Secure Connect Bundle
* How to manage a Cassandra Session within a JAVA web application
  
## How this Works
This is an example of a Spring Boot Microservice for use with the Astra Getting Started UI which is found [here](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-ui).

## Get Started
To build and play with this app, follow the build instructions that are located here: [https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-java#prerequisites)

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup.

### DataStax Astra
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=UTM_CODE) if you don't 
already have one:

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Add Database`**

5. Your Astra DB will be ready when the status will change from *`Pending`* to **`Active`** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Paths:
*Make sure you've completed the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) before starting this step*
  - [Running on your local machine](#running-on-your-local-machine)

### Running on your local machine
Make sure that you have:
* Java 11+
* An Astra compatible Java driver, instructions may be found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudConnectJavaDriver.html) to install this locally.
* An Astra database with the CQL schema located in [schema.cql](src/main/resources/schema.cql) already added.
* The username, password, keyspace name, and secure connect bundle downloaded from your Astra Database.  For information on how to obtain these credentials please read the documentation found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudObtainingCredentials.html).

This application is a Spring Boot web application. This sample can be run from the root directory using:
```sh
cd getting-started-with-astra-java

mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will startup the application running on `http://localhost:8080`

You will know that you are up and working when you get the following in your terminal window:
```sh
16:23:01.569 INFO  com.datastax.astra.GettingStartedWithAstra  : Started GettingStartedWithAstra in 1.851 seconds (JVM running for 2.39)
```

#### Access the API documentation from a browser

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

*Note: If you want to change the listening port of the application, locate the file `src/main/resources/application.yml` and change key `server.port`*

#### Setup the user interface to use this backend
To setup the UI to connect to Java backend define a `.env` file in the `getting-started-with-astra-ui` project main directory. Inside the file it should have one entry pointing to this project's API endpoint:
```sh
BASE_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8080/api
```
Once you start that project with a `npm run build` it will point the UI to the backend API which will then be using Astra as a database. When you first connect to the UI, a dialog box will open asking for Astra connection information.
